Docker Compose
 -> Tool for defining and running multi-container docker application
 -> Use yaml files to configure application services(docker-compose.yml)
 -> Can start all services with single command : docker compose up
 -> Can stop all services with a single command : docker compose down
 -> Can scale up selected services when required

Step 1 : Install docker compose
         (Already installed on windows & mac with docker)
         Check its version by >> docker-compose-v
      
         If not installed then use -
         >> pip install -U docker-compose

Step 2 : Create docker compose file at any location on your system
         >> docker-compose.yml (file name must be this or thisname.yaml)
 ( In this file we have to written command in yaml lang.)
for eg. 
       
services:
  web:
   image: nginx
  database:
   image: redis

Step 3 : Check the validity of file command
         >> docker-compose config
            (if output of this will give the matter present in mention file 
             then command is successful)
Step 4 : Run docker-compose.yml file by command
         >> docker-compose up -d
Step 5 : Bring down application by command
         >> docker-compose down
