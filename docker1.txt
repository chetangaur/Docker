# Docker

Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use 
OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called 
containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their 
own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate 
with each other through well-defined channels

# Containers:-
     Containers allows a developer to package up an application
with all the parts its need, such as library,database and others, and
ship them all togerther as a single package.

# How docker works

Docker forms a docker image using dockerfile.
  Dockerfile consists of application , requirement etc.
Then this docker image launch a docker container which is a run time instance

@ To find docker images docker hub is one of the best source.

6. Docker Server
7. Docker Engine


# Benefits of using Docker

1. Build app only once
2. No worries that the application will not perform the same way it did on testing env
3.Portability
4.Version Control
5.Isolation
6.Productivity
7.Docker simplifies
DevOps
